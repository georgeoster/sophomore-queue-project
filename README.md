ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:

create and test a class for a queue of objects. You may use any object class of your choice as the data for the queue.
The instances of the class should have at least one field that distinguishes them from other instances of the class (key field).

Your queue class should contain:
a  pointer to the first element in the queue,
a pointer to the last element in the queue,
and the size of the queue. 

You should have methods to:

instantiate a null queue

enqueue 

dequeue 

return queue size

return head of queue

return tail of queue

a boolean isEmpty method


You will need to create a class of node for the data in the stack, which we call a queueElement. Each queueElement should have a data element, a pointer to the next element, and the following methods:

A null constructor

An initializing constructor (instantiates a queueElement from a data element)

set and get methods for the data elements

return the data in a queue element

set the pointer to the next element

return the pointer to the next element

This assignment requires four classes â€“ Queue, QueueFrame, the data object class, and a class for your test project.
